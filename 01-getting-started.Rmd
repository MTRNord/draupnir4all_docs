# Getting started

All the things you need to know to get set up will be here. If some are missing
please feel free to open an issue at https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/draupnir4all_docs

## Registration

```{block2, type='rmdimportant'}
In the early stages I am going to limit the amount of people that can register
to figure out proper scaling of the components.
There will be announcements on the status page when the registrations are paused.
```

To register you need to write an email to `draupnir4all@midnightthoughts.space` or open a ticket directly at https://osticket.midnightthoughts.space/open.php.

Inside of the email you need to provide these infos:

- The matrix ID of the person that is the admin of the provisioned bot. This is NOT the name or id of the bot itself.
- An estimate of the amount of rooms going to be moderated. This doesn't need to be accurate but helps estimating the resources needed in the early stages.

After you have sent the email you will get a reply by me (MTRNord) when you are registered with further instructions how to get your draupnir instance.
